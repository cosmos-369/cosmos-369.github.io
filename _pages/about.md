Hi, I am a computer science engineering student with an interest in programming, particularly web development. I engage in the online community under the handle "Matrix"
Currently, I am pursuing my B.E. in Computer Science Engineering, I am currently focused on expanding my programming skill set.
Beyond coding, I like to do 3D art and also play chess(i am not very good at it though)

I invite you to explore my work
